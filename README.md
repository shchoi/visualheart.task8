### Overall Task - 8
___
**Create Visual for ETAS and Alarm Data in Report** 
- Understand the parameters of the model
- What are our axes
- PDF versus CDF
- Create graph output for the coordinate data we receive from the analyzers - output the two graphs on the same coordinate plane
- Create a residual plot to compare the two models
- Is there a correlation between the two models? Is the residual plot white noise?
- How do we determine the fit between the lines in the plot?


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals

Specific
- Create graph outputs for ETAS and Alarm Data based on the data provided by the analyzers
- Overlay two graphs on the same coordinate plane and compare
- Create a residual plot to compare the two models & determine if it is white noise
- Look for a correlation b/w the two models

Measurable
- (*note* all of this should be available after receiving the relevant data from analyzers)
- The data for each model will be measurable by its parameters and axes
- The fitness of the lines should be measurable (should come up with a way)
- If any, the correlation between the 2 models should be measurable

Attainable
- Contact analyzer groups to attain the data for visualization
- Our output is not attainable yet. 

Relevant
- We thought it is a relevant idea to reach out for Brad Luen by identifying his current contact information and ask about - MDA model; -> We found that one of the vertical groups has already done so and supposedly got a reply back, which we should inquire them for.
- Will reach out for other visualizers to get a better picture of visualization of this project as a whole

Time bound
- By Sunday 10PM: post rough draft for SMART goals
- By Monday 11:59PM: post SMART goals; have an understanding of how our group fits into the big picture; get into contact with the other groups 
- Most of our timeline is dependent on the timelines of the other groups (such as the analyzers)


## ROADBLOCKS

- Difficulty in communicating with others 
 - To solve this, we tried contacting other groups using Github, Facebook, and office hours
 - Our presenter met up with other presenters, and through this we were able to understand what the other groups are doing
 - Visualizers created a Facebook group and tried to reorganize ourselves, following the analyzers' examples on Github
- Late group organization
 - Because of this, we met up with each other twice, and kept in frequent contact via Facebook, Github, and phone apps
 - Created a common Github issue tracker to organize our SMART goals (This one!)
